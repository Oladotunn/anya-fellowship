# Research on Defi Projects and Blockchain Networks

## 5 Defi Projects

<p>DeFi which means Decentralized Finance, is the movement that focuses on providing/transforming the old financial products into trustless and transparent protocols that run without intermediaries in the crypto space (decentralized networks). This movement cuts across different industries like payments, insurance, exchanges, market management tools etc. Some examples of defi projects are listed below </p>

- DAI: This is an Ethereum-based stablecoin launched and governed through the Maker Platform and MakerDAO. The main difference between DAI and the other popular stablecoins is that DAI is fully decentralized and is integrated by hundreds of dapps and DeFi projects. The DAI stablecoin used to be collateralized only with Ethereum but nowadays is multi collateralized
- SuperFluid: This is a novel crypto-asset streaming protocol for payments that enables transformative web3 money experiences like salary and subscription streaming, real-time investing, and more – all on-chain. It helps with handling subscriptions, salaries, rewards and any composable stream of value, with continuous settlement and per-second netting for extreme capital efficiency. 
- IDEX: This is a non-custodial exchange that integrates with any custody solution and allows users to trade with one another without giving up control to a third-party custodian. It helps combine a high-performance order book and matching engine with Automated Market Making (AMM) and blends the best of centralized and decentralized exchanges, with the performance and features of a traditional order book and the security and liquidity of an AMM.
- Avalanche (AVAX): This is an interoperable smart-contracts platform for launching decentralized finance applications, financial assets, and other services. The platform supports the Ethereum virtual machine as well as application-specific sharding, network-level programmability, and NFTs. It uses a proof-of-stake consensus protocol to offer a network where decentralized assets are traded and launched by users with sub-second transaction confirmations
- Uniswap: This is a trading protocol built to be an on-chain automated market maker (AMM) that can determine the price of a cryptocurrency based on the ratio of two cryptocurrencies within a pool.  This exchange platform allows for the exchange and trade of various DeFi tokens, as well as Liquidity Provider tokens. 


## Blockchain Networks 
<p>A blockchain network is an infrastructure that provides ledger and smart contracts services to applications. These smart contracts are shared across all peer nodes in a network where they are immutably recorded on their copy of the ledger.</p> 

- Public Network: This is the blockchain network type that gives the public visibility on it’s ledgers, incoming and outgoing transactions, block states and block counts. Blockchains in this network are referred to as completely decentralized and they are secured by the economics of cryptographic verification like proof-of-work and proof-of-stake. The public blockchain network is also anonymous in itself hence, it’s a safe space to practice transactions securely without having your identity traceable. Examples are bitcoin and ethereum
- Private Network: Also known as permissioned network, it is a network type that is managed and administered by a private entity. While the central authority in the network decides/authorizes who can be a node, it does not always grant each node identical rights to execute functions. However, because public access to private blockchains is restricted, they are only partially decentralized. Examples are Ripple and Hyperledger
- Consortium Network: This is a network type that’s also permissioned but instead of by a single entity, it’s managed by consortium of organisation. This results in more decentralization and hence more security. However, setting up this network type could prove difficult because it necessitates collaboration across several business while some supply chain members may lack the necessary technology or infrastructure to adopt blockchain technologies.
- Permissioned Network: The Permissioned Network typically is setup by businesses that operate on a private network and sometimes the public network as well. This network type limits authorizations to the network itself and what transactional activities can be carried out on chain. Usually, nodes are joined to the chain by invitation. Permissioned storage are more decentralized in its data storage while ensuring that all records have immutable signatures which increases security since all transactions are encrypted cryptographically.
